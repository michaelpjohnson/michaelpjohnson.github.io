Development life-cycle now begins in Kitchen/Vagrant vs. dedicated dev environment in the data center. Deployment is done via Python/Fabric scripts. They are repeatable and tested via Jenkins.
* Utilized DevOps principles to architect and deploy highly-available systems. These systems were built by Chef and tested automaticaly with Jenkins.
