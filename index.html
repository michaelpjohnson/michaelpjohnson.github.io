<h2 id="lead-devops-engineer">LEAD DEVOPS ENGINEER</h2>
<p>I am an IT expert with over 16 years of professional experience. My career began as a full-time developer and slowly transitioned into a full-time SysAdmin. This range of skills has given me a unique perspective on the DevOps philosophy and how it best fits within an organization. My next career goal is to lead a team of individuals who are integrating DevOps tools into their software lifecycle.</p>
